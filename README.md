# counter.ahk
Script that serves as a counter by allowing the ability to increment/decrement/reset. Functions are mapped to keyboard keys via a rudimentary GUI. Current counter number is stored in a separate .txt file.

Originally, the script was intended to keep track of the number of deaths in a given video game (hence the file name "death.ahk"), but it can be used for any purpose that requires a counter.
